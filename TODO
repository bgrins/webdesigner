Add text editing: http://code.google.com/p/rangy/wiki/SelectionSaveRestoreModule
Persist changes (using backbone with localstorage to keep things simple for now)
Duplicate a file
Group elements together (nesting based on DOM structure, class names, create your own groups)
Have a workflow for showing different portions of comps (either to compare two different ideas)
** Opaque overlay of one on another?
Possibly assign actions directly to different comps (click on submit -> switch to PageSubmit)

Image editing type things:
